# Independant Project #2

#### Our 2nd independant coding project for the evening intro class, 6/7/19

#### By Craig Hutler

## Description

Create a webpage (using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery) where a user can answer questions about themselves and be given a reponse based on their answers.

* Include a minimum of 5 survey questions.
* Offer a minimum of 3 vacation destination suggestions.
* Don't forget your Git commits AND README.
* Note: You are not required to take every possible combination of answers into account. Feel free to use very simple logic, or even ignore the user's responses for some questions.

Your code will be reviewed for the following objectives:

* All previous standards (last review's objectives) are in place (see below).
* Site uses branching to return destination.
* jQuery is used to show and hide destination after questions are answered and submitted.
* Form gathers input from the user.
* Variable names are descriptive of what they represent.
* Web page is styled using Bootstrap and custom CSS.
* Code has proper indentation and spacing.
* Commits are made regularly with clear messages that finish the phrase "It willâ€¦".
* Project README that includes: author name, program name, description,copyright and license information
* link to project on GitHub Pages
